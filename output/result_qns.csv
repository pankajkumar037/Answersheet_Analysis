39,4,"The above image is that of a reflecting telescope. Reflecting telescopes revolutionised our ways of looking into the sky. They employ mirrors to gather and focus light, rather than relying solely on lenses as in their refracting counterparts. These telescopes utilise precisely shaped and polished mirrors to capture incoming light and reflect it to a focal point, where it forms an image for observation."
